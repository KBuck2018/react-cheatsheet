# Reusable Components

### Why reusability is important

Reusability will allow you to make applications more efficient, thi can be done by making one function or method that can be used in multiple ways. Such as a form, if you have a website that has several different pages of forms, you can create a universal form once to cover however many forms you really need.

### Reasons why Reusable components are important:

-They allow for stronger building blocks in applications, if the reusable components work, then incorporating them in should work.
-Allow you to detect issues quicker, if an aspect of your reusable component breaks, the application is broken down into smaller components and will be easier to detect than something massive coding libraries.
